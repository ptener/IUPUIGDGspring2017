Hi everyone, welcome to our EICB tour, aboard the Earth Interplanetary Cosmos Base. I am Amelia Gagnon and you're looking through the lens of our resident robo-naut, Recordo! 
Sorry you can't see my face, but all us astronauts have to keep our suits on for the time being. We're all fine and well, it's just a time-consuming process we're going through.With all that, let's get started.
So over here is our exercise station, used by our 3-time Olympic gold medalist, Jaxon Kelly!
She keeps responding that everything is normal...How could the AI of the shuttle do that to the airlo-
DAH!-Oh!-Hey-O! Amelia, Recordo, HE is working alright, yeah?
Of course, my adorable robot pal is a-okay!
